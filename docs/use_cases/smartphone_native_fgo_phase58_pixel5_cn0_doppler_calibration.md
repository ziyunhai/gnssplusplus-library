# Phase 58 Pixel5 C/N0/Doppler residual calibration audit

Phase 58 audited Android per-satellite `Cn0DbHz` against a raw code/rate
closure residual on four route-disjoint Pixel5 recordings.  The audit was
truth-free and did not read navigation, coordinates, IMU, solver output,
MATLAB, validation/holdout data, archives, or an earlier metric payload.
Each pinned `device_gnss.csv` was read once in one process.

The fixed residual was

```text
e = (P_current - P_previous)
    - 0.5 * (PseudorangeRate_previous + PseudorangeRate_current) * dt
```

after subtracting the same `utcTimeMillis`/hardware-clock-group median.  The
source-supported shape was `10^(-(Cn0-40)/20)`.  All predeclared route,
coverage, monotonicity, leave-one-route-out calibration, non-common-mode,
factor-impact, and presentation gates passed.  The four sealed LOO scale
values were 0.7726573316542686, 0.7720231442247758, 0.7416064915523163, and
0.7453335259209156 m/s at 40 dB-Hz.  Their exact median fixes the implementation
scale at **alpha = 0.7586783350728457 m/s**, without manual rounding.

The audit itself made no native correction.  A separately frozen implementation
stage is authorized with the exact rule

```text
sigma = max(existing_champion_doppler_sigma_mps,
            0.7586783350728457 * 10^(-(Cn0DbHz - 40)/20))
```

It is FGO Doppler-only, opt-in, coefficient one, and has no upper clip or SPP
application.  The existing p85/12 upstream quality path is not reimplemented
or mutated.  Phase 43 remains champion and Phase 51 remains experimental;
`0.782` is not evaluated without truth.

## Native structural matrix

The separately sealed native implementation uses the exact opt-in flag
`--native-cn0-doppler-calibration` and the fixed floor above.  The existing
p85/12 path, default behavior, row eligibility, and graph structure remain
unchanged.  Before any structural run, the freeze was explicitly resealed to
include the existing Phase43 fallback seed quality-anchor recovery flag in the
flag-off recipe; this changed no formula or threshold.  The resealed freeze
hash is `b4884659a84be8c3afd5daf6f9bbab11fae958b34af942190aa4eb6ef313d526`.

The four-route truth-free matrix ran control once and candidate twice per
route.  All structural gates passed: candidate repeats were byte-identical,
control output and summaries matched the Phase43 flag-off artifacts, and the
projected non-calibration structure was identical.  Candidate telemetry was:

| Route | adopted Doppler factors | finite C/N0 | sigma floor affected | model sigma median/p95 (m/s) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| MTV-a | 61,726 | 61,726 | 61,722 | 1.4964343974954437 / 4.95516000267792 |
| MTV-h | 73,264 | 73,264 | 73,264 | 1.3965538373231767 / 5.309549603410619 |
| LAX-t | 34,293 | 34,293 | 34,293 | 1.6408076888124188 / 5.309549603410619 |
| MTV-u | 24,373 | 24,373 | 24,372 | 1.5669591779028265 / 5.309549603410619 |

The matrix used 12 native solver invocations and 12 one-process reads each of
the pinned GNSS, IMU, and navigation inputs; truth, validation/holdout, MAT,
WLS, precomputed coordinates, and Kaggle/token access were all zero.  No
accuracy truth or `0.782` evaluation is authorized by this structural result.
The emitted structural result SHA-256 is
`1f675f8f3a1cb93e4c0cb8705f22a78d6f47242d292a1dd0938fc046e575b74b`; its

## Phase59 immutable accuracy evaluation

Phase59 scored only the sealed Phase58 candidate run 1 and control run 1, using
the exact Phase44 Haversine/percentile contract.  Each prediction key matched
the truth domain exactly (`prediction_domain_coverage = 1.0`); the single
leading warm-up truth row on MTV-a and MTV-u remained unmatched and is reported
separately as truth-row coverage.  Each of the four development truth files
was opened once in one scorer process.  No solver/native process, raw GNSS/IMU,
navigation, archive, validation/holdout, MAT, WLS, precomputed coordinate, or
Kaggle/token input was used.

| Route | candidate score (m) | control score (m) | improvement (m) | candidate P50/P95 (m) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| MTV-a | 2.1200092363239786 | 2.1200062765249656 | -0.0000029597990130 | 1.2928714594079849 / 2.947147013239972 |
| MTV-h | 3.6069568184393780 | 3.6069657083098825 | 0.0000088898705046 | 2.4288494968087693 / 4.785064140069987 |
| LAX-t | 4.5116227356432660 | 4.5116562020153950 | 0.0000334663721286 | 3.4051076585670574 / 5.618137812719475 |
| MTV-u | 3.9071640240689350 | 3.9071587965102856 | -0.0000052275586495 | 3.3995962638253920 / 4.414731784312478 |

The candidate macro is **3.5364382036188893 m** versus the exact control
macro **3.536446745840132 m**, an improvement of only
**0.0000085422212428 m**.  All route-wise improvement gates (minimum 0.05 m),
the MTV-h improvement gate (minimum 0.10 m), and the macro improvement gate
(minimum 0.10 m) fail.  The candidate macro limit (2.0 m) and route-score
limit (3.0 m for MTV-h/LAX-t/MTV-u) also fail; therefore the result is
**no-go-development-accuracy-gates**.  The 0.782 m value is report-only and
was not reached.  Phase43 remains champion and Phase58 C/N0 calibration stays
experimental; no validation or Kaggle action follows.  The next single
source-supported factor is a raw Android `FullInterSignalBiasNanos` +
`SatelliteInterSignalBiasNanos` consumption/sign audit, not a combination with
Phase51.
