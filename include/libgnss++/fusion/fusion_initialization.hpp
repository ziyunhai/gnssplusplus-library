/**
 * @brief Coarse static leveling + gyro bias estimate from a stationary IMU
 * window.
 *
 * Roll/pitch come from the mean specific-force direction (the body-frame
 * direction that measured the gravity reaction while stationary): the
 * rotation that maps this direction onto ENU's Up axis is the minimal-angle
 * (yaw-free) tilt-only rotation, found via Eigen::Quaterniond::FromTwoVectors
 * -- equivalent in substance to the reference's
 * `pitch = atan2(ax, sqrt(ay^2+az^2))`, `roll = atan2(ay, az)` coarse
 * leveling (reference_notes.md 4.4/7 Step A), expressed without a frame- and
 * gimbal-order-dependent Euler-angle formula. Yaw is left at whatever this
 * minimal rotation implies (i.e. effectively unset/arbitrary) --
 * tryAlignHeading() is expected to correct it once GNSS course is available.
 * Gyro bias is the mean raw gyro over the window (stationary => raw gyro is
 * pure bias). Accel bias is the residual after removing gravity along the
 * sensed direction (reference_notes.md 4.4:
 * `bias_acc = acc_mean - g*(acc_mean/||acc_mean||)`).
 *
 * @param stationary_window_body_flu  IMU samples, already remapped to body FLU
 * @param initial_position_enu        Position to seed (ENU tangent frame)
 * @param gravity_mps2                Local gravity magnitude

 * @brief Buffers GNSS course-over-ground samples over a sliding time window

 * Root cause this addresses (PPC nagoya/run1 investigation): the old
 * single-epoch tryAlignHeading() call latched heading on the very first GNSS
 * fix whose speed exceeded threshold. On nagoya/run1 that first qualifying
 * epoch happened during the vehicle *backing out of a parking space* --
 * GNSS course-over-ground is the direction of travel, not the vehicle's nose
 * heading, and during reverse motion those two differ by ~180 deg. The old
 * code had no way to notice this and latched a badly wrong yaw with an
 * artificially tight (5 deg) sigma, from which the filter never recovered
 * (tokyo's runs never hit this because their initial motion happens to be
 * forward). Requiring several seconds of *mutually consistent* course
 * samples before latching does not, by itself, distinguish forward from
 * reverse motion (a sustained reverse maneuver is just as "consistent" as a
 * sustained forward one) -- the complementary fix is
 * LooseCouplingProcessor's post-latch velocity-innovation health check
 * (fusion_processor.hpp Config::heading_recovery_*), which de-latches and
 * lets this tracker re-acquire once real forward motion produces a
 * persistently large velocity residual against the wrong latch.
 *
 * The assigned post-latch yaw sigma is `max(heading_sigma_deg,
 * observed circular scatter)`, so a latch coming from a noisier window is
 * never reported more confident than the data that produced it (contrast
 * with the old code's fixed, optimistic 5 deg regardless of input quality).
