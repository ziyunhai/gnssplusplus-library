"""Skip guards for sealed-artifact and frozen-source contract tests.

The smartphone research lanes pin historical source/binary hashes and read
artifacts generated under the git-ignored ``output/`` tree. Neither the frozen
revision nor those artifacts exist in a clean checkout, so the contract tests
skip when their precondition is absent instead of failing CI. When the
precondition is present the tests still enforce the full contract.
